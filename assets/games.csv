http://www.infocom-if.org/games/stationfall/stationfall.html,Stationfall,Steve Meretzky,1987,Science-Fiction,Advanced,"After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state buring coal and gas for energy and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11203 GY a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol and for five generations your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once you joined the Patrol you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet Resida and saved it from near destruction.The story of that heroic deed was told in Planetfall. As a result of your heroics you were offered and quickly accepted a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida five long years have dragged by without a single event worthy of note. Why just look at today's ""thrilling"" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...",http://www.infocom-if.org/games/stationfall/stationfallfront_th.jpg; http://www.infocom-if.org/games/stationfall/stationfallback_th.jpg,Stationfall front; Stationfall back
http://www.infocom-if.org/games/deadline/deadline.html,Deadline,Marc Blank,1982,Mystery,Expert,"A wealthy industrialist Mr. Marshall Robner locked himself in the upstairs library of his New England colonial estate one night and committed suicide by taking a lethal overdose of anti-depressants. Or did he? You are the Chief of Detectives. You've been asked by Robner's attorney to make a thorough investigation of the case simply to ""quash the suspicions which are inevitable"" when a moneyed man dies a sudden and unnatural death. The Medical Examiner found nothing unusual and interviews with family members and family associates are consistent with the idea that Robner committed suicide. Everything fits neatly -- maybe too neatly. You smell foul play and you have 12 hours to crack the case. If you arrest someone you'd better have the three traditional ingredients to an ironclad case for the prosecution: the accused must have had a motive a method and ample opportunity to commit the crime. There are many possible endings to this case and the one you reach is determined by your actions and by the deductions you draw from the evidence you gather. But one ending fits the facts better than any other and you will know it when you reach it.",http://www.infocom-if.org/games/deadline/deadlinefront_th.jpg; http://www.infocom-if.org/games/deadline/deadlineback_th.jpg,Deadline front; Deadline back
http://www.infocom-if.org/games/nordbert/nordbert.html,Nord & Bert,Jeff O'Neill,1987,Interactive Short Stories,Expert,"Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It is different from any other Infocom story you may have seen. Rather than being one long story it's a collection of eight short stories or scenarios. Each of the eight stories involves some sort of punning wordplay or verbal trickery. The people and items you meet in one scenario won't appear in another and so each story is played independently of the others. However to get into the scenario called Meet the Mayor you need to know seven passwords. You get one password everytime you complete one of the other seven scenarios. You can play these other seven scenarios in any order. Nord and Bert also differs from other Infocom stories in that no mapping is needed and you won't use compass directions to move from one place to another. Instead the status line (at the top of your screen) will tell you what places you can go next. For example the status line might say something like this: You can go: Barn Stable Field Just type the name of the place you want to go and press the RETURN (or ENTER) key; in this case you can just type BARN or STABLE or FIELD. Another new feature of Nord and Bert is the inclusion of hints. If you ever get stuck you can type HINT and press the RETURN (or ENTER) key. Then follow the instructions on your screen. Hints are organized by subject: so if you are stuck on a problem which involves a hat look for hints under the word ""hat."" Nord and Bert also has a new way of examining objects. You can examine an object in any of the stories just by typing the name of the object. For instance to look at a trash compactor you can type LOOK AT THE COMPACTOR or more simply COMPACTOR. Of course you also might want to LOOK INSIDE or OPEN THE COMPACTOR. To solve some of the short stories you will need to ""transform"" some objects into other objects by using hormonyms or ""spoonerisms."" (Hormonyms are different words that sound the same like ""bare"" and ""bear""; spoonerisms are words with sounds transposed like ""blowing grade"" and ""growing blade."") For example: There are some lunching mobsters here. >MUNCHING LOBSTERS With guns and butter but without missing a mouthful the lunching mobsters around the table become munching lobsters. or A tuft of hair rocks gently in the breeze. The hair twitches. >HARE A cute brown hare hops toward you nose and tail twitching.",http://www.infocom-if.org/games/nordbert/nordbertfront_th.jpg; http://www.infocom-if.org/games/nordbert/nordbertback_th.jpg,Nord & Bert front; Nord & Bert back

But the Taiko has died leaving as heir a seven-year-old boy and a five-man Council of Regents to rule in his name. The dominant figures of the Council are Lord Taranaga and Lord Ishido. Each is a daimyo: powerful warrior-rulers who follow the ancient samurai traditions. Each harbors the ambition to be Shogun: supreme ruler under the divine but nearly powerless emperor. Toranaga and Ishido are backed by lesser daimyos and hordes of Samurai. They jockey for position nearly evenly matched looking for any way of bolstering their chances. Perhaps the Jesuits will swing their support behind one candidate or hostages will neutralize a powerful supporter. The balance is delicate and the appearance of the Erasmus creates excitement and new possibilities. It is into the center of this momentous conflict that you John Blackthorne have been thrown and soon you discover that the perils of the sea are almost trifling compared to the danger and intrigue among the samurai lords of Japan. Life in Japan can be a hazardous affair. If you choose the wrong friends or confidants you may find your head detached from your body. But strict adherence to the rules of etiquette some judicious questions and careful listening will enhance your pleasure prestige and prospects for survival.,http://www.infocom-if.org/games/shogun/shogunfront_th.jpg; http://www.infocom-if.org/games/shogun/shogunback_th.jpg,Shogun front; Shogun back
http://www.infocom-if.org/games/fooblitzky/fooblitzky.html,Fooblitzky,Marc Blank Mike Berlyn Poh C. Lim and Paula Maxwell,1986,Board game,,"Most of you interactive fiction fans love the puzzles in Infocom's games. But many of you may not realize that puzzle-solving is also an important part of Infocom's first graphics strategy game Fooblitzky. Here is a Fooblitzky-like logic puzzle; see if you can figure it out. Imagine a town where stores sell only 12 items and where the currency is ""foobles."" Now suppose a contest is held in the town and 4 of the items are secretly designated ""right items."" Your goal is to figure out what the 4 right items are. To help you out city officials tell you the cost (in foobles) of the 4 right items. And every time you bring items to City Hall you'll be told how many of the items you have are right. However you won't be told which items are right. Given the following information can you tell which are the 4 right items? Items costing 4 foobles: banana fish hair spray and screwdriver. Items costing 8 foobles: light bulb sardines snake and toothpaste. Items costing 16 foobles: eyedropper hot dog pig and saw. Suppose you're told that one of the right items costs 4 foobles one costs 8 foobles and two cost 16 foobles. Assume that the two 16-fooble items are different. Player 1 goes to City Hall with a banana a snake an eyedropper and a pig and learns that she's carrying 2 right items. Player 2 goes to City Hall with a banana a light bulb and a snake and learns that he too is carrying 2 right items. Player 3 goes to City Hall with sardines a hot dog a pig and a saw and learns that he is carrying 1 right item. Player 4 goes to City Hall with hair spray toothpaste and a saw and learns that she's carrying 1 right item. With this information you should be able to deduce what the 4 right items are. (In a real game of Fooblitzky you couldn't assume that the two 16-fooble items are different. Try deducing the 4 right items again this time allowing the two 16-fooble items to be the same or different. Is there more than one possibility? Answers here.) Figuring out the right items is just part of the fun in Fooblitzky. You can bump into other players to steal their items; buy or sell items at the pawn shows at discount prices; ride the UGH (the underground gliding highway) to move around the city quickly; hide items from other players in lockers; and so on. And the Chance Man can show up any time sometimes to help you and sometimes to hinder you. Fooblitzky is a lot like your favorite board game: you play against your friends or family rather than against the computer. As in interactive fiction there are dozens or hundreds of alternatives at every turn. And there are so many possibilities in Fooblitzky no two games are alike. We've even put several variations into the program so you can make the game easier harder or stranger.",http://www.infocom-if.org/games/fooblitzky/fooblitzkyfront_th.jpg; http://www.infocom-if.org/games/fooblitzky/fooblitzkyback_th.jpg,Fooblitzky front; Fooblitzky back
http://www.infocom-if.org/games/bureaucracy/bureaucracy.html,Bureaucracy,Douglas Adams (with the staff of Infocom),1987,Comedy,Advanced,Once upon a time (not very long ago) a man moved from one apartment in London to another. He dutifully notified everyone of his new address including his bank; in fact he went to the bank and filled out a change-of-address form himself. The man was very happy in his new apartment. Then one day the man tried to use a credit card but couldn't. He discovered that his bank had invalidated his credit card. Apparently the bank had sent a new card to his old address. For weeks the man tried to get the bank to acknowledge his change-of-address form. He talked to many bank officials and filled out new forms and tried to get a new credit card issued but nothing worked. The man had no credit and the bank behaved like well a bank. It's a sad story one that gets replayed every day for millions of people worldwide. Of course sometimes it's not a bank at fault: sometimes it's the postal service or an insurance company or the telephone company or an airline or the Government. But all of us at one time or another feel persecuted by a bureaucracy. You begin Bureaucracy in your new house. As per the letter in your package you will fly to Paris (for business and pleasure) just as soon as you get some money to take you to the airport. That money should be in today's mail so you should be off soon... unless of course there's some problem with the mail. Oh by the way: The man in our story about the bank was Douglas Adams the principal author of this game.

The prosperity of your nation and the four neighboring kingdoms has long been maintained by a peaceful network of Druidic sects. The Druids - priests who dwell and pray in groves and wooded glens - have proven themselves to be the wisest advisors and the most lucid of judges. The Druid Council a forum for the various Druidic cults is a powerful and benevolent body whose opinions are valued in the kingdoms throughout the land. Among the most prestigious of sects is that of the Tree Druids who traditionally send at least one of their number to each of the five nearby kingdoms. Their advice both political and spiritual is always respected and depended upon. However during the last six months the usually-stable Tree Druids have begun to act unnaturally. Their attendance at the Druid Council has become oddly erratic and the sect's communication with other Druidic colonies has mysteriously dwindled to nothing. The crops about the Tree colony which had always been faithfully nurtured and harvested now lay overgrown and abandoned. Sinister rumors of epidemic and disaster quickly spread through pubs and taverns. Many an eager adventurer journeyed forth to the Tree Druid colony buried beneath a great oak to find out first-hand what foul fate had befallen the colony though none returned to offer explanation. Three months ago all traces of the sect vanished entirely. Three scouts - famed warriors named Bruno Jaroo and Eolene - were sent by nearby colonies to find out what had happened. Several weeks have passed without a word from them however and once again the people of Rhea have grown restless for news of the sect.

The story begins in the world of 2031 a world on the brink of chaos. The economy of the United States of North America (USNA) has been stagnating for decades. Crackpot religions are springing up all over the place. Crime and urban decay are rampant. Schools have become violent chaotic places ill-suited for educating children. Today's youth frequently use joybooths to ""tune-out"" the world leading in the extreme case to joybooth suicide where a psychological addict wastes away in his or her private nirvana. The global situation is even grimmer. The calcuttization of the Third World has almost reached its limit causing extreme overpopulation and poverty. This has created a climate ripe for East Bloc adventurism exploiting instability and fanning the numerous flash points around the globe. The superpower race to build an impenetrable missile defense has ended in a tie with the foreseeable but unforseen result that an even more dangerous arms race has begun -- a race to build miniature nuclear weapons some as small as a cigarette pack and smuggle them into enemy cities -- a race which threatens to turn the USNA into a giant police state. Things are bad and it appears that they can only get worse. So when Senator Richard Ryder along with a small group of leaders from government business and the universities announces the Plan for Renewed National Purpose everyone is only too willing to embrace it. Only one thing stands between the Plan and its adoption: a test of its validity. That's why you have been ""awakened"" from your simulated life and had your true nature revealed to you several years ahead of schedule. You have been chosen to use your unique abilities to enter a simulation of the future based on the tenents of the Plan in order to check its effectiveness.
